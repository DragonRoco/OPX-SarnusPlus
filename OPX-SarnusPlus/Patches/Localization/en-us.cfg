		// Vizak
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Vizak_Name = Vizak^N
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Vizak_Desc = Vizak is a small moon orbiting within the rings of Sarnus, serving to keep the beautiful arrangement of particles and gaps in its shape. How do we know this thing is there? Uhhh... sh shu shut up
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Vizak_Biome_S = Surface
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Vizak_Biome_ER = Equatorial Ridge
		
		// Ryla
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Ryla_Name = Ryla^N
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Ryla_Desc = Along with Hale and Vizak, Ryla is a small moon which works to shepherd the particles of Sarnus' rings. It's orbit takes it very close to the outer edge of the system, but little else can be said about it until a visit is made.
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Ryla_Biome_P = Poles
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Ryla_Biome_TR = Temperate Regions
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Ryla_Biome_H = Highlands
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Ryla_Biome_IC = Impact Craters
		
		// Masmar
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Masmar_Name = Masmar
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Masmar_Desc = After countless hours of trying to remove a dirt speck from pictures of Sarnus, one plucky astronomer, since promoted to the test flight program, pointed out that it's probably a moon. Masmar's surface is inert and pockmarked, with a prominent equatorial crater clearly visible from afar as the moon's most important feature. It's definitely not anything else. Just a crater. Yessir. 
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Masmar_Biome_SC = Sovereign Crater
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Masmar_Biome_SCP = Sovereign Crater Peak
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Masmar_Biome_KC = Kessel Crater
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Masmar_Biome_KCR = Kessel Crater Rim
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Masmar_Biome_KCCP = Kessel Crater Central Pit
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Masmar_Biome_PB = Polar Basins
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Masmar_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Masmar_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Masmar_Biome_H = Highlands
		
		// Encethys
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Encethys_Name = Encethys
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Encethys_Desc = Discovered at the same time as Plock, the square heads in charge of cataloging the astronomical discoveries mixed up the records of two celestial bodies, leading to years of one being confused for the other. The surface of Encethys is very smooth and nearly devoid of large craters, which could be the result of cryovolcanic activity. This might mean that the moons harbors a liquid ocean beneath its frozen crust.
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Encethys_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Encethys_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Encethys_Biome_H = Highlands
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Encethys_Biome_LC = Lonely Crater
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Encethys_Biome_LCP = Lonely Crater Peaks
		
		// Eeloo
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Eeloo_Desc = The third major moon of Sarnus, Eeloo is a fairly standard ball of rock and ice, its surface cracked by tidal interactions between Sarnus and its sister moon of Slate. While once theorized to have a subglacial ocean, scientists now agree that this makes more sense for Encethys, leaving Eeloo to be much more boring than it was initially thought to be.
		
		// Hypo
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Hypo_Name = Hypo
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Hypo_Desc = LÃ¸mpy boi
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Hypo_Biome_P = Pits
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Hypo_Biome_H = Highlands
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Hypo_Biome_L = Lowlands
		
		// Phabus
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Phabus_Name = Phabus
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Phabus_Desc = Phabus is the outermost moon of Sarnus, orbiting in a somewhat elliptical, retrograde orbit far beyond even Hypo. Its dark surface holds many secrets about the past of the Kerbol System. More esoterically, the home of the gods in ancient Kerbal mythology was described as floating high above the farthest planet, then considered to be Sarnus. Some crackheads continue to believe in such myths, and consider Phabus to be the site of this mythic structure.
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Phabus_Biome_IC = Impact Craters
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Phabus_Biome_L = Lowlands
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Phabus_Biome_M = Midlands
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Phabus_Biome_S = Slopes
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Phabus_Biome_H = Highlands
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Phabus_Biome_P = Peaks
		
		// Surface biome of all pseudobodies
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Common_Biome_S = Surface
		
		// Egin
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Egin_Name = I3-Egin^N
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Egin_Desc = Egin is a very small object orbiting within the so-called Egin ring, formed by dust blasted off its surface by micrometeoroid impacts. This ring is very sparse, and is generally only visible backlit.
		
		// Palar
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Palar_Name = I4-Palar^N
		#LOC_OPX-SP_Palar_Desc = Ovok's little cousin. This small moon is similar in characteristics to Ovok, and orbits in a similar position. I'm not sure if the KSC knows anything else about it.
		
  		// Seri
    		#LOC_OPX-SP_Seri_Name = I5-Seri
      		#LOC_OPX-SP_Seri_Desc = One of the few trojan moons in the Kerbol System, Seri is a miniscule rock held in orbit by the balanced gravities of Slate and Sarnus. Seri's tiny size means that it could serve as a good refueling site for missions into Slate's deep gravity well.
		
		// Research Bodies
		#LOC_OPX-SP_RB_Vizak = ITS A UFO! WE'RE UNDER ATTACK! What's that? Moon? Sarnus is right there? Oh. Uhhh. I'll call it... Vizak. Yes. Definitely not a keysmash.
		#LOC_OPX-SP_RB_Ryla = Stop putting lentils in front of my telescope.
		#LOC_OPX-SP_RB_Masmar = This little guy whizzing around beyond Sarnus' rings must have suffered a beating in its youth, with that giant crater.
		#LOC_OPX-SP_RB_Encethys = This thing is way too bright. Our telescopes are failing to pick out any detail on its surface. Definitely made of ice, though.
		#LOC_OPX-SP_RB_Hypo = Who put this pumice stone in space? I don't think that's where it goes. 
		#LOC_OPX-SP_RB_Phabus = Wow, I'm lucky I found this thing! It really is way out there from the rest of the moon system, I sure hope there isn't anything related to an alien molecule. 
		
		// Tarsier Tech
		#LOC_OPX-SP_TT_Hale = Look at this little lump of rock. So small!
		#LOC_OPX-SP_TT_Vizak = I think this is a burger... in SPACE!
		#LOC_OPX-SP_TT_Ryla = PLEASE stop putting lentils in front of my camera.
		#LOC_OPX-SP_TT_Masmar = Wow, that's one hell of a crater.
		#LOC_OPX-SP_TT_Ovok = Egg.
		#LOC_OPX-SP_TT_Encethys = I still can't find any detail on this thing's surface.
		#LOC_OPX-SP_TT_Eeloo = Still giving dwarf planet vibes. I dunno why though.
		#LOC_OPX-SP_TT_Slate = This planet has no right being out here. I can see mountains and river valleys and mid-ocean ridges. What happened here?
		#LOC_OPX-SP_TT_Tekto = Lots of green clouds. I wonder what's underneath it?
		#LOC_OPX-SP_TT_Hypo = Still do not know why this pumice stone is out here.
		#LOC_OPX-SP_TT_Phabus = Perfectly ordinary asteroid... yessir. Nothing amiss.
